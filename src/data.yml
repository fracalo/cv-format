summary: |- 
    Currently working as web developer in La Spezia - Italy - UTC +1,  
    consultant at Sun-times srl.  
    The stack used in recent projects has been principally focused on React, Node, and Redux,
    but apart from that I have a variegated experience, and like to experiment custom solutions.  
    The programming language I'm most comfortable with is JS.  
    I have an all-around experience in design softwares
    (before being a developer I was a designer),  
    I enjoy plunging into details and always increasing the automation process.

    - period:
          from: 'Feb. 2017'
          to: 'present'
      company: Sun-Times srl
      core_business: Web, Advertising, Press. 
      position: Lead Full-Stack Developer.
      descr: |- 
          In Sun-Times I'm responsible for the web-development sector, maintenance of pre-existing projects and general advisor for the technology to propose and implement for the company's clients and for it's own projects.   
          With approximatly 100 open projects, ST has historically been developing on legacy Lamp stacks,   
          through my arrival we have renovated the kind of products we deploy:  
          I improved the service-providers used for our sites/projects,
          some projects with specific needs were brought to AWS,
          while I generally enforced a more encapsulated environment for every new project (even the smallest ones).
          For what regards the Wordpress development (which is large share of the overall projects),
          an which rappresents ST's milk cow, we strove to increase the performance of the sites deployed, through creation of optimized themes with a special attention to the customization of the backend.
          Furthermore I had the opportunity to set up a project made with React for internal administrative purpose.

      company: Entreprenuer at PS SRLS
      core_business: Customized services & Ecommerce.
      position: Front and Backend Development, Web Design, Marketing & Sales.
      descr: |
          PS was an evolution from the work done with the previous activity (Premispezia), while still providing custom graphic service, we focused on one spefic niche product (military wooden shields).
          The best description for the business model is _vertical_ (from production to sales), this model helped rationalize costs and concentrate strength on one single product.
          All the distribution was done through a personally developed e-shop (using Prestashop framework).
    - period:
          from: 2007
          to: 2013
      company: Entreprenuer at Premispezia SAS
      core_business: Selling customized products and services.
      position: Graphic designer, product craftsman and seller.
      descr: |
          The company was born, from my initiative, with the goal to serve markets related to sport-awards, ceremonies and technical sportswear;
          as the company and context evolved the focus started to change toward merchandising, and more generally any kind of graphic service.
          The products were customized through engraving, embroideries, screen-print, digital-print, plotter-filming, and similar technologies; the services constisted of printing marketing material, websites and integrated campains.
    - period:
          from: 2003

      company: Bancroft Europe Imports SRL
      core_business: European distributor of the Bancroft military cap and accessories
      position: Sales & Marketing
      descr: |
          Bancroft Europe's core was the distribution of the American brand 'Bancroft' which had much appeal at the time in the Italian and European military market.
          The working environment was quite dynamic; in the period in which I was at this company,
          the workforce consisted of 6-8 persons (and for many duties we were all interchangeable).
          Being involved in the marketing I promoted, developed and managed the company's website - www.bancroftemporium.it (which also included an ecommerce section which was quite innovative for the time - made in Flash)
