        Currently working as a freelance web developer in La Spezia - Italy - UTC +1.
        The stack used in recent projects has been principally focused on React, Node, and Redux,
        but apart from that I have a variegated experience.
        The programming language I'm most comfortable with is JS.
        I have an all-around experience in design softwares
        (before being a developer I was a designer),
        I enjoy plunging into details and always increasing the automation process.'
